            <p>As an AD I was responsible for all things communication and marketing at Crimson. I recognised the oportunity to broaden the target audience to not only the photographer segment but also the arty artists, illustrators and graphic designers. The aim for all ads produced by and for Crimson was profiling and brand awareness rather than promoting single products.</p>

            <h5>Consistance</h5>
            <p>To illustrate the consistancy in deliverables we picked up the icon for icc profile.</p>
            <h5>Flexibility</h5>
            <p>To show the powerful possibilities of customising the product such as change saturation, levels, add frames and so on.</p>
            <h5>Punctuality</h5>
            <p>It was important to convey the understanding and respect Crimson has for their clients deadlines.</p>
            <h5>Diversity</h5>
            <p>How do you illustrate diversity? You list, print, branch out and grow roots - right.</p>
            <h5>Passion</h5>
            <p>Passion - the essense of nerdiness. Designers are usually very nerdy about their cause. It was easy to just look within in this regard. Color, space, typogrphy, hex-text, you name it.</p>
            <h5>Experience</h5>
            <p>A challange, how do you illustrate experience? We did it by bringing light on both old and new technologies, while also always keep the work in focus.</p>
            <h5>Unity</h5>
            <p>The grand finale - a combination of all key values, or value illustrations.</p>

            <p>The mission was to move from manually handling all finished orders and products to a digital system. This would involve creating a physical system as well, where products would be scanned and place in a logical place where the service desk could easily find them. We decided to build a custom shelf for the system, so I created a pattern to be printed on the side. Loved it!.</p>

            <p>We created three different divisions to support the different users. One neutral, to do status checks, one for hte user working at the warehouse and another for the receptionist to find and hand the order to the customer.</p>
            <h5>Visual design</h5>
            <p>The three divisions were separated by colors and symbols, which moslty already existed. That allowed me to focus more on the technical parts rather than design details.</p>
            <h5>Focus on functionality</h5>
            <p>There was opportunity to add lots of small bonus functionality. This was due to the early findings and the result was very much appreciated by both staff and customers as it improved the whole flow.</p>
            <h5>The physical system</h5>

            <h5>The concept</h5>
            <p>To complement the offering Halebop wanted a resvice to ease staying in touch with friends and family abroad. So they created Locall - an app with great quality and fixed low prices to call abroad. A part of the concept was also gamification where the user could earn minutes to call a selected destination.</p>
            <h5>First implementations</h5>
            <p>Just before this project started we finished another project Halebop had asked us to do, a full rebrand. By keeping one of the amazing designers from that project we managed to to deliver not only what was asked but also lots of fun bonus features.</p>
            <h5>Some details</h5>
            <p>Reace Native, with all that it involves, the good and the less good. Made for both IOS and Android, released in App store and Play store. This initiative was also driven by growth hacking so there were focus on tracking to lead the development forwad.</p>
            <h5>The release</h5>
            <p>The solution was quietly rolled out during the summer 2017. This enabled an extensive iteration period to improve and fine tune before the more spectacular promotion event. The app usage grows each day thanks to the approach of measure-test-validate.</p>

        <p>UI/UX designer | Frontend developer | Illustrator</p>
        <p class="about-text">I'm what they call a hybrid, a multi talented person. My passions are broad but somehow they always manage to relate to each other. Design is my premier and is where I have my roots. That said, frontend development has been a part of my professional role since 2014.</p>
        <p class="about-text">In the period of one day I switch between sketching with regular pen and paper, creating flows and designs in sketch, moving over to Visual Studio Code and the terminal. Most often also lots of browser or simulator testing. As a hybrid the speed and freedom is high and enables the possibility to influence, the process as well as the end result. It contributes to a broader understanding of processes and concepts, and for colleagues, partners and clients.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Outside work there is a whole lot of play going on, very much often with my son Loa, but also in the form of side projects and other interests such as drawing, painting, photography and social lofe. Absolutely addicted to bubbly water, mustard and list making. A couple of times per year I leave the city to spend some quality time with family and old friends on my home island Gotland. I'm generally a humble and caring person with a positiv attitude. Yep.</p>
