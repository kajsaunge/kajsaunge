        <p class="em pdg-btm">Cart and checkout</p>
        <p>We were a team of two, one backend developer and me as UI/UX designer and frontend developer. I left the comfort of Sublime to fall inlove with PhpStorm. After creating user flows and some initial ideas for design I did most of the design work in code and also fell inlove with SCSS and flexbox. I managed to convice the very experienced and somewhat stubborn team mate to move from Subverion to Git.</p>

        <p>As an AD I was responsible for all things communication and marketing at Crimson.

        <p>Passion - the essense of nerdiness. Designers are usually very nerdy about their cause. It was easy to just look within in this regard. Color, space, typogrphy, hex-text, you name it.<br/><br/></p>
        <h5 class="project-sub-heading page-scroll">Experience</h5>
        <p>A challange, how do you illustrate experience? We did it by bringing light on both old and new technologies, while also always keep the work in focus.<br/><br/></p>
